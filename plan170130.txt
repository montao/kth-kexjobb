Learn difference between verification and testing

Choose (1) USB in general and its theory (2) ALU as a peripheral and how to verify an ALU, distinct from testing it which we already did in Quartus

Examine the different proof techniques (1) Proof that covers all possible cases (2) Inductive proof

Make a time plan like a flow chart (waterfall) which steps should be performed in which order
